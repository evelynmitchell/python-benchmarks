| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `90d3cd9` | Fix critical package shadowing bug and add project tooling |

## Lessons Learned

- uv 0.9.17 installed and used for pre-commit and test dependencies
- Package name `python-benchmarks` causes mypy issues (hyphens not valid in Python package names)
- Existing code has minor linting issues (pylint 9.51/10) - mostly style/docstring related
- No GitHub Actions workflows or Dockerfiles yet (zizmor/hadolint skipped)
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXED:** Directory names (`numpy/`, `async/`, etc.) were shadowing real Python packages - moved all tests under `benchmarks/` folder

## Next Steps

- **P1:** Add `pyproject.toml` for proper uv/pip dependency management
- **P1:** Fix unused variables in `run_benchmarks.py` and `benchmarks/utils/profile_memory.py`
- **P2:** Add GitHub Actions CI workflow for multi-version testing
- **P2:** Update review document to reflect fixes made
